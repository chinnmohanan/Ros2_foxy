In the new terminal, source your main ROS 2 environment as the “underlay”, so you can build the overlay “on top of” it:
            source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
Go into the root of your workspace:
            cd ~/ros2_ws
In the root, source your overlay:
            source install/local_setup.bash

From the root of your workspace ros2_ws, you can now build your packages using the command:
            colcon build
