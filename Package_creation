Create a package
Open a new terminal and source your ROS 2 installation so that ros2 commands will work.
Navigate into the ros2_ws directory.
Recall that packages should be created in the src directory, not the root of the workspace. So, navigate into ros2_ws/src, and run the package creation command:

        ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake cpp_pubsub

Your terminal will return a message verifying the creation of your package cpp_pubsub and all its necessary files and folders.
Navigate into ros2_ws/src/cpp_pubsub/src. 
Recall that this is the directory in any CMake package where the source files containing executables belong.
