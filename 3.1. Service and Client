Creating a Simple Service and Client
Create a package
Open a new terminal and source your ROS 2 installation so that ros2 commands will work.
Navigate into the ros2_ws directory created.
Recall that packages should be created in the src directory, not the root of the workspace. Navigate into ros2_ws/src and create a new package:

ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake cpp_srvcli --dependencies rclcpp example_interfaces

Your terminal will return a message verifying the creation of your package cpp_srvcli and all its necessary files and folders.

The --dependencies argument will automatically add the necessary dependency lines to package.xml and CMakeLists.txt. 
example_interfaces is the package that includes the .srv file you will need to structure your requests and responses:

int64 a
int64 b
---
int64 sum

The first two lines are the parameters of the request, and below the dashes is the response.

Update package.xml

Because you used the --dependencies option during package creation, you don’t have to manually add dependencies to package.xml or CMakeLists.txt.
As always, though, make sure to add the description, maintainer email and name, and license information to package.xml.

<description>C++ client server tutorial</description>
<maintainer email="you@email.com">Your Name</maintainer>
<license>Apache License 2.0</license>

Write the service node
Inside the ros2_ws/src/cpp_srvcli/src directory, create a new file called add_two_ints_server.cpp and paste the code from file "add_two_ints_server.cpp" available in repository.



Add executable
The add_executable macro generates an executable you can run using ros2 run. Add the following code block to CMakeLists.txt to create an executable named server:

add_executable(server src/add_two_ints_server.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(server rclcpp example_interfaces)

So ros2 run can find the executable, add the following lines to the end of the file, right before ament_package():

install(TARGETS
    server
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})

You could build your package now, source the local setup files, and run it, but let’s create the client node first so you can see the full system at work.


Write the client node

Inside the ros2_ws/src/cpp_srvcli/src directory, create a new file called add_two_ints_client.cpp and paste the code from the file "add_two_ints_client.cpp", available in the repository.





Add executable
Return to CMakeLists.txt to add the executable and target for the new node. 
After removing some unnecessary boilerplate from the automatically generated file, your CMakeLists.txt should look like this:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(cpp_srvcli)

find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(example_interfaces REQUIRED)

add_executable(server src/add_two_ints_server.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(server rclcpp example_interfaces)

add_executable(client src/add_two_ints_client.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(client rclcpp example_interfaces)

install(TARGETS
  server
  client
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})

ament_package()




Build and run
Navigate back to the root of your workspace, ros2_ws, and build your new package: 
colcon build --packages-select cpp_srvcli



Result

Open a new terminal, navigate to ros2_ws, and source the setup files:

source install/setup.bash

Now run the service node:

ros2 run cpp_srvcli server

The terminal should return the following message, and then wait:
[INFO] [rclcpp]: Ready to add two ints.

Open another terminal, source the setup files from inside ros2_ws again. Start the client node, followed by any two integers separated by a space:
ros2 run cpp_srvcli client 2 3

If you chose 2 and 3, for example, the client would receive a response like this:

[INFO] [rclcpp]: Sum: 5

Return to the terminal where your service node is running. 
You will see that it published log messages when it received the request and the data it received, and the response it sent back:

[INFO] [rclcpp]: Incoming request
a: 2 b: 3
[INFO] [rclcpp]: sending back response: [5]


Enter Ctrl+C in the server terminal to stop the node from spinning.
