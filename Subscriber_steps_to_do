Write the subscriber node
Return to ros2_ws/src/cpp_pubsub/src to create the next node. Enter the following code in your terminal:

      touch subscriber_member_function.cpp

Entering ls in the console will now return:

publisher_member_function.cpp  subscriber_member_function.cpp

Open the subscriber_member_function.cpp with your text editor.
Paste the contents of subscriber_member_function.cpp in the repository.

===================================================================================================


Since this node has the same dependencies as the publisher node, there’s nothing new to add to package.xml.

CMakeLists.txt

Reopen CMakeLists.txt and add the executable and target for the subscriber node below the publisher’s entries.

add_executable(listener src/subscriber_member_function.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(listener rclcpp std_msgs)

install(TARGETS
  talker
  listener
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})

Make sure to save the file, and then your pub/sub system should be ready.
Build and run

Still in the root of your workspace, ros2_ws, build your new package:
colcon build --packages-select cpp_pubsub



Open a new terminal, navigate to ros2_ws, and source the setup files:

Result
Now run the talker node:
ros2 run cpp_pubsub talker
The terminal should start publishing info messages every 0.5 seconds, like so:
[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: "Hello World: 0"
[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: "Hello World: 1"
[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: "Hello World: 2"
[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: "Hello World: 3"
[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: "Hello World: 4"

Open another terminal, source the setup files from inside ros2_ws again, and then start the listener node:
ros2 run cpp_pubsub listener
The listener will start printing messages to the console, starting at whatever message count the publisher is on at that time, like so:
[INFO] [minimal_subscriber]: I heard: "Hello World: 10"
[INFO] [minimal_subscriber]: I heard: "Hello World: 11"
[INFO] [minimal_subscriber]: I heard: "Hello World: 12"
[INFO] [minimal_subscriber]: I heard: "Hello World: 13"
[INFO] [minimal_subscriber]: I heard: "Hello World: 14"

Enter Ctrl+C in each terminal to stop the nodes from spinning.
